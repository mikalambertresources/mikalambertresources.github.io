							<h2>Graduate school preparation resources</h2>
							<p><b>Looking for some advice on the graduate school application process? Below are some resources, tips, tricks, and examples of 
							successful PhD application materials specifically for astronomy programs!</b></p>
							
							<p>First off, it's important to know whether or not graduate school 
							is the right path for you! A PhD program is more than
							just "the next step" in your academic career. Graduate school is
							where you learn how to be an independent researcher on the cutting-edge of
							humanity's knowledge. It can be both incredibly challenging but 
							equally rewarding to know you're making an impact in your field!</p>
							<p>If this sounds exciting, great! Graduate school may be for you!</p>
							
							<p>Outlined below, there is advice I have for a <b>general timeline</b> of the
							process, <b>graduate application statements</b>, and the <b> NSF graduate student fellowship statements</b>, as well as additional resources 
							I found helpful when I applied! </p>
							
							<p>I also want to note that there are many shortcomings and ways to improve the admissions
							process on the universities' side. There is still a long way to go before
							this system becomes more equitable. With that being said, I hope to aid current and future applicants with
							relevant advice and plan to update this site when changes are implemented across graduate programs applications.</p>

										<h2 class="major" align="center">A Brief Timeline of the process</h2>
										<p align="left">If I could change one thing about my experience, I would have started 
										planning earlier! It is easier to remain organized the earlier you start, so
										here is a loose timeline that I would recommend when undertaking this endeavor.</p>
										<p align="left"><b><u>Summer before your final year of undergraduate (June-July):</u></b> Start looking into potential programs at different schools.
										Decide what you are looking to get out of a career post-undergrad. Are you enthusiastic about astronomy research? or physics? 
										or maybe optics? Can you focus your interest into a subfield, exoplanets, galaxies, instrumentation?
										 This will help you <b>narrow down a list of specific programs.</b> At this point, it's important to note
										 that you don't want too small of a list either. An aspect that I believe can increase your chances of success is
										 being open to as many programs as possible. Graduate admissions is a numbers game and often seen as a crapshoot since so
										 many deserving people apply for so few spots.
										  The more programs you apply to
										 the more likely you are to be admitted to one! (A caveat is that you should still be
										 happy with going to <i>any</i> of the schools on your list and there is no such thing as a safety school for graduate programs).
										 However, the application process is not accessible to everyone when application fees
										 can range from $50 to over $100! It is super important to <i>apply for fee waivers</i>!!
										  This extra step can relieve a lot of economic stress
										 when it comes to applying.
										  Finally, this is the time to make your CV (Curriculum vitae) or updated it! A CV is an academic resume tailored to your academic and research achievements (see below for an example) </p>
										<p align="left"><b><u>Beginning of final academic year (August):</u></b> The beginning of the academic year is a great time
										to ask for <b>letters of recommendation.</b> Most astronomy programs want three letters, so it's good
										to give each letter writer as much time as possible to compose a strong letter. If you plan to apply
										for the NSF graduate student fellowship, they will also ask for three letters of recommendation.
										Sometimes it can be difficult to think of three different people to ask for these letters, but a good place to start is asking your research advisors or
										post-docs with whom you worked closely,
										academic advisors (i.e. a professor who taught a class you were engaged in or maybe TA'ed for), or faculty sponsors for a club in which you 
										played a role. Sometimes the merit of the letter
										is more powerful than the prestige of the person writing the letter. However, make sure they can write a <i>strong</i> letter for you.
										 Don't be afraid to keep
										tabs on your letter writers' progress, especially when the deadline is approaching! <p>
										<p align="left">Furthermore, now is a good time to <b>cold email faculty at schools</b> you are interested in to see if they plan on taking students.
										Taking the initiative to reach out to them has the potential of 
										showing how committed you are to the program, and they may remember your determination during admissions.
										 The worst case scenario is that they don't respond, so trying will not hinder your potential.</p>
										
										<p align="left">You may also want to consider <b>applying for the NSF graduate student fellowship</b>. The application requires
										a personal statement and a research proposal <a href="#three">(see below for details)</a>, and the deadline is normally in October, so make sure to give yourself
										plenty of time to prepare.
										 If you have previous research experience, it could be helpful to reach out
										  to your advisor to brainstorm research proposal ideas. If this is your first time writing a proposal, it may be daunting, so their expertise
										  is vital! There is no harm in applying for the NSF GRFP as an undergraduate student because if you don't receive the award,
										  you can always re-apply in graduate school, but you are allowed only one try once you are in a graduate program.
										 </p>
										<p align="left"><b><u>October:</u></b> This is normally when the NSF GRFP is due, so make sure all materials for that are ready! 
										This is also a good time to start <b>drafting a <i>general</i> graduate school personal
										 statement and statement of purpose.</b> You can tailor it to each school when the deadline approaches. 
										 If you applied for the NSF GRFP this should make drafting up your essays easier! Around this time is ideal to have
										 a solid list of schools you want to apply to.</p>
										<p align="left"><b><u>November:</u></b> Now would be a good time to <b>ask for feedback on application materials.</b> You can ask
										 your letter writers, and current graduate students in your department! Also, see if your current institution is holding
										workshops and editing sessions for graduate school application materials. This is also the time to start tailoring your
										 statements to specific schools. Beware of different word/character limits for different schools! 
										 Reaching out for fee waivers at the programs you want to apply to around this time is also favorable.</p>
										<p align="left"><b><u>December:</u></b> Time to polish up statements, update your CV once more, and confirm your letters of recommendation
										 are ready and... <b>time to submit!</b> Most applications are due in the first half of december depending on the school.
										CONGRATS you made it through the past few months!! The application process can be an exhausting time period, so it is commendable to put in such effort.
										Some schools will also have an interview stage in January or early February. Most of the time they will give you the questions they will ask in advance
										to allow you to prepare.
										Decisions normally happen between January and March depending on the program. 
										</p>
										
										<p align="left">I strongly recommend having an 
										<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AvMTKgHpglwJlDZEaXNuDrPaB33XZorONHM4RBlLoAs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><b>organization system</b></a>
										 to keep track of programs you are interested in,
										and it benefits your letter of recommendation writers so they can also tailor their letters to the different programs!</p>

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major" align="center">Graduate Program Statements</h2>
										<p>I believe the most important component to a graduate program application are the statements. Whereas a CV will tell them who you are, the statements
										<i>show</i> them who you are with a clear and direct narrative of your experiences!</p>
										<p>The key elements I believe reviewers 
										look for are varying levels of experience and merit in these three categories as follows:</p>
										<h4 style="font-size:20px;">Academics</h4>
										<ul>
													<li>Coming into graduate school with a 
														breadth of knowledge in the general field will set you up for any 
														research project you may start. If you have experience applying your academic knowledge in facets
														such as tutoring or TAing, it speaks volumes to your readiness to be a mentor as a graduate student.</li>
													<li>Taking graduate level classes as an undergraduate highlights a similar point, and could be refered to in an application
													statement.</li>
													<li>There has be effort to de-focus an
								 						applicant’s academic merit solely on their GPA. If you had a bad semester, grade-wise, these statements are
								 						an opportunity to explain why.</li>
													<li>Be clear about weaknesses and more importantly how you overcame them. 
													The committee will care more about resilience than a perfect GPA.</li>
												</ul>
												
												
												
										<h4 style="font-size:20px;">Research</h4>
										<ul>
													<li>Your primary role in a graduate program
										 			is to learn how to be an independent researcher, 
										 			so having experience beforehand demonstrates your 
										 			readiness to dive deeper in graduate school.</li>
													<li>Research experience shows your curiosity in the field, and determination to explore!</li>
													<li>It's important to paint a narrative of what YOU contributed to the research project
													and what you learned from it.</li>
													<li>If you are participating in a research project,
													admissions committees are interested in research products 
													such as being an author on a paper, or presented
													 a poster at a conference or symposium. Giving an expected timeline of such events in your statements can show
													 your organization and time management skills.</li>
													<li>If you haven’t done as much research or don't have research products yet,
													  it may be beneficial to give an explanation. Participating in research as an undergraduate 
													  is a privilege as you are not guaranteed 
													  to be paid for your work, and most admissions committees will recognize that some students will prioritize a job that
													  pays a living wage over research progress.</li>
												</ul>
												
										<h4 style="font-size:20px;">Outreach/Service</h4>
										<ul>
													
													<li>Outreach experience highlights your sense of community and
													 initiative to broaden your goals to more than just research.</li>
													<li>Science communication is vital to our field at different audience experience levels.</li>
													<li>Astronomy has a large underrepresentation of POC because of the initial barriers to enter.
													Two large barriers are not having early exposure to the possibilities of this type of career
													 and not having the confidence to pursue STEM.
													Outreach events lower these barriers and promotes interest in astronomy.</li>
													<li>Some examples of outreach can include organized public "star parties" on your local campus or at primary and secondary schools, and
													something as simple as tutoring your neighbor's
													  child can also show outreach initiatives.</li>
													<li>Astronomy is an inherently privileged field,
													 some might view it as a form of escapism, so my personal view is that
													  it’s important to stay grounded to
													   humanity through outreach because that’s where it all started. 
													   Since the beginnings of human history, we've wondered why we are here and what is our place is the cosmos.</li>	
													<li>Again most outreach opportunities are
													   volunteer-based so socio-economic 
													   factors may play a role in how much
													    you’ve been able to participate is 
													    important to acknowledge as well.</li>
												</ul>
												
										<p>Now how do you split these topics between a "statement of purpose" and "personal statement?"
										<b>The statement of purpose</b> should be dedicated to 
										why you want to attend graduate school, and show evidence that you would excel in graduate school.
										Therefore, emphasizing research experience is imperitive in the statement of purpose. It is also inmportant
										to show that you have looked into the program you are applying to! Examples of this would be mentioning professors
										you would like to work with as well as interesting outreach projects the department runs. 
										(This is where you are tailoring your general graduate statements to specific schools)
										The <b>personal statement</b> is best used to narrate a bit of your background, expand on any outreach/service you've
										 done in your community, and explain any hardships
										 you’ve face that have impacted your academics and how you overcame them.</p>
										 <p>
										 <b>Overall, it is important to show them that you are a good fit for their program and that they are a good fit for your future goals!</b>
										  </p>	
										 
										 <p>Below are example statement of purposes and personal statements that were successful. Some schools asked for combined
										 statements, or only a statement of purpose which is something to be mindful of.</p>
										<ul class="actions">	
											<li><a href="Research_Statement_combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="button">Statement of Purposes</a></li>
											<li><a href="Personal_Statement_combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="button">Personal statements</a></li>

										<h2 class="major" align="center">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program </h2>
										<p align="left">The National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) is a
										highly renowned fellowship granted to students entering (or are in their first two years of) a science-based PhD program and 
										are either a US citizen, national, or permanent resident.
										A fellowship lasts five years, with a stipend offered for three of those years while the other two years are classified as "on reserve."
										This takes the burden off your PhD advisor to find funding for a graduate student and can also grant freedom to a graduate student who wants
										to work on a specific project. 
										For a more in depth explanation visit their website here: 
										<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" ><b>NSF GRFP website</b></a>
										 The solicitations are their rules for submission, and can change from time to time so it is important to read.
										 Referring back to the <a href ='#one' >timeline</a> there is no harm in applying for the NSF GRFP the fall of your final academic year.
										 If you are not rewarded then, you can apply during your first OR second year of graduate school but not both years in graduate school.
										 The benefit of applying during graduate school is you may have a more defined research proposal and experience with research writing
										 techniques by then.</p>
																				
										<p align="left">What does the application process look like?</p>
										
										<p align="left">The application requires a personal statement, a research proposal, and three letters of recommendation.
										The statements are slightly different from a PhD program application because the NSF has stricter criteria that one must follow.
										For both the personal statement and research proposal you must include an "intellectual merit" and "broader impacts" section.</p>
										
										<p align="left">The <b>personal statement</b> will look like a combined version of a graduate program’s statement 
										of purpose and personal statement. Under intellectual merit, you can talk about your research 
										experience or any other academic challenges you’ve overcome. Under broader impacts, you can talk
										 about outreach services you’ve done and a little bit about what you plan to do once you are in 
										 graduate school. In both categories make sure you are using specific examples of things you did! The 
										 final informal section to include is a future goals section. This should be about where you see 
										 yourself a few years into graduate school as well as the path you want to take after graduating with a PhD. </p>
										 
										 <p align="left">The <b>research proposal</b> is a bit different.
											The purpose is to show that you are ready to be an independent researcher and can propose your own project! 
											If you are currently doing research you can talk with your advisor to help generate ideas and
											 to guide you down the right path. Most of the proposed research methodology will go in the intellectual
											  merit portion of the statement. Make sure to include a timeline of different phases of your project like
											   checkpoints. The broader impacts section is meant to get you thinking about how this project will benefit
											    the community in general, as well as an in-depth explanation of any outreach you plan to do in graduate school.</p>
										
											<p align="left"><b>A common phrase is that the “GRFP funds the person not the project” meaning 
											they care more about your potential to be a leader in the future more than the specific project you propose!</b></p>
										 
										 <p align="left">The example below was written when I was first-year graduate student.
										  It is important to note that reviewers assess undergraduate and graduate statements separately.</p>
